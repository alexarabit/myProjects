#In this analysis, I will be analysing how the most common way to use the platform of Hacker News. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result. Thus, it is useful to know what types of posts are most popular.
#There are two types of posts: posts that ask questions and posts that show projects and products. We can see which type of post is more popular by seeing which one gets more comments.
#Note that this dataset has been reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions.
